                                Have you been thinking about becoming a frontend web
                                developer, but dont know where to start? This short
                                article will help you know where you can find the
                                right resources, what to do and what to not do to
                                become a seasoned frontend web developer in as short
                                as a year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before you consider learning frontend web
                                development, you should already know the basics of
                                user interface and user experience design! It helps
                                to know the basics of using tools like Figma,
                                Photoshop or Adobe XD, but it's not necessary!
                                Additionally, you should know always know the basics
                                of user accessibility.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, let's say you've already started learning the
                                basics of HTML & CSS, and you're on your way through
                                learning JavaScript. Most people, would give up at
                                this stage, because JavaScript is kind of tough,
                                unlike CSS and HTML that they've been using! However
                                there are multiple platforms available online that
                                can help you to master JavaScript even if you're a
                                total beginner!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My all time favorite platform is Freecodecamp. With
                                freecodecamp, you have access to a project based,
                                self paced JavaScript course, that will make sure
                                you undestand the fundamentals correctly, and then
                                you can build up from there! When you've completed
                                the JS course on freecodecamp, you can then start
                                doing projects on sites like frontendmentor, just to
                                improve on your HTML, CSS & JS.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After you feel like you know enough, you can then
                                pickup a JS framework. The most recommended
                                framework for frontend developers, as of now, is
                                ReactJS. There are many resources for learning
                                ReactJS, my favorite being scrimba. After completing
                                the course on scrimba, you can then again start
                                making more projects. The resources are available
                                and infinite. So good luck on your learning journey.
